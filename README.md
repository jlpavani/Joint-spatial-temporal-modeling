# Joint-spatial-temporal-modeling

Data and R code to support Pavani and Moraga (2022).  In this paper, we describe geographic and temporal patterns of two mosquito-borne diseases, dengue and chikungunya, and their possible risk factors in the Brazilian state of CearÃ¡ in 2017. To pursue this, we consider a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model for the joint analysis of both arboviruses. This specification also uses a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model to overcome the high proportion of zeros. Moreover, it includes covariates as well as disease-specific and shared spatial and temporal effects, which are estimated and mapped to identify similarities among diseases.
