# Joint-spatial-temporal-modeling-

Data and R code to support Pavani and MOraga (2023).  In this paper, we model the geographic distributions of dengue and chikungunya over the years 2016 to 2021 in the Brazilian state of CearÃ¡. We use a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model for the joint analysis of two arboviruses that includes spatial covariates as well as specific and shared spatial effects that take into account the potential autocorrelation between the two diseases.
